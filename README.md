# cryptocurrency_predictor

This is a repo exclusively dedicated to my Masters Final Project in KSchool

I intend to make a crypto currency predictor based on twitter sentiments.

To achieve that I need to get access to the Twitter API and retrive tweets that contain "Bitcoin" for an specific period of time with the `tweepy` library.
Then I will retrive bitcoin historic prices from another API, probably "messari" or "cryptocompare"

I will probably add some more features to the model such as the main stock market indexes or gold historic price.

I am working to figure out everything.
I hope I'll be updating this pretty often.
