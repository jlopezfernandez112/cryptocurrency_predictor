# Bitcoin Predictor

### Intro

Since 2009, there has been a radical new way of making payments. The creation of the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment system, Bitcoin, has led to the creation of a novel and booming set of payment services, known collectively as cryptocurrencies. These virtual currencies are not created or backed by any government, nor does anyone user have complete control over them.
Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency out there in market capitalization and its price has been rapidly increasing since it was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, reaching over $ 60,000 per coin on April 2021.
In the recent years, cryptocurrencies have been widely used for trading and speculation, and many investors are seeking their chance to make a fortune out of them, as the crypto market is, indeed, extremely volatile.
Accurate stock market predictions are of great interest to these investors; however, crypto markets are influenced by volatile factors such as any kind of news that make it hard to predict based on merely historical data.
Nowadays, social media contains both, financial news and personal opinions of leading figures that can change investorsâ€™ behavior.
In this project we present a method for predicting Bitcoin closing prices utilizing Twitter sentiments and Google Trends as well as the volume of Bitcoins traded and past Bitcoin closing prices.
